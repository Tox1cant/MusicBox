# MusicBox
Python Code that runs mono mp3 files from an sd card and has a switch that is used as on/off and skip song at the same time.


Hello,
This Board will play music thru a speaker once the switch is in the open position (the music box is opened).
If the music box is opened before you provide power it will start playing music.
The board is reading music from an SD card slot.

To add new songs or remove songs use the SD card of any size and on the SD car make sure that you have the mp3 file(s).
To add music you should use dirpy.com/studio, coppy the youtube link from the song and place it in the search function, then select the download audio option.
After that use Audacity Software (you can get it from this link: https://www.audacityteam.org )

Follow these steps for dirpy:
1. Youytube video link
2. Paste the link into search Function
3. Select Highest (320kbps) mp3 audio
4. Press record Audio button and wait for the download

Follow these steps for Audacity:
1. first open file: File > Open > select the song you just downloaded using dirpy; then follow these steps: File > Export Audio > Export to computer
2. format = mp3 files; audio options: Channels: Mono, Sample Rate: 22050Hz, Bit Rate Mode: Preset, Quuality: Medium
3. Export the file to Desktop and make sure it works before loading it into the SD card ;)
4. to verify that its mono channel you can open the file in audacity and you should only see one audio bar when compared to previous files 2 audio bars
(audio bar - I mean the noise/sound waveforms)

Now add the Songs to the SD card and try it out ;)

It will sort the songs for you as well. To see how the sorting will be performed you can choose tho list the mp3 files in file explored by name in decending order.
So the songs will be aranged with the same principal as the name sorting in file explored ;)
